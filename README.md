# snakeGame

## Description

This is the famous Nokia 3310 game in which a moving object (snake) merges (or eats) randomly appearing objects (food) on the display screen. As the snake eats the food, it increases in lenght. However, if the snake touches the border of the play zone, is gameover. Likewise if the snake collides (eats) its self, is also game over.

## Purpose

This game represents a MVP which was part of my study assignment and aimed at improving my understanding and implementation of queues data structure.
